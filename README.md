# NST-with-ML-
NST stands for neural style transfer. this program performs photo style transfer with the help of convolutional neural networks(CNN). it utilises a very interesting and important property of CNN. that is different layers in the network capture different amount of features of a image.
# WHAT IS PHOTO STYLE TRANSFER?
through photo style transfer we can style any image which can extracted from any other image such that the original objects or figures of the styled image still remain the same.

the whole concept is based on the fact that different layers of a convolutional neural network captures different amount of features of an image.
as a result we can adjust the amount of style that will be dispalyed in our original image.
